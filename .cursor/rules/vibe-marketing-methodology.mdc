# Vibe Marketing Methodology

## Core Principle
**Vibe marketing is the systematic practice of packaging the same fact-rich story in multiple emotional wrappers to match the audience's cultural and psychological state.**

## Content Creation Framework

### Always Reference Strategy Foundation
Before creating any content, consult these strategy documents:
- [tone_of_voice.md](mdc:strategy/tone_of_voice.md) for brand voice consistency
- [brand_analysis.md](mdc:strategy/brand_analysis.md) for positioning and differentiation
- [competitor_tracking.md](mdc:strategy/competitor_tracking.md) for market context

### Content Structure Template
Every piece of content should follow this structure:
1. **Hook**: Compelling story or scene that establishes emotional stakes
2. **Framework**: Clear, numbered steps that readers can implement
3. **Evidence**: Specific data, case studies, and real examples
4. **Call-to-Action**: Collaborative rather than prescriptive language

### Use Content Templates
All content should start with appropriate templates from [templates/](mdc:templates):
- [blog-post-template.md](mdc:templates/blog-post-template.md) for long-form content
- [case-study-template.md](mdc:templates/case-study-template.md) for client stories
- [social-thread-template.md](mdc:templates/social-thread-template.md) for social media

### Emotional Mapping Process
1. **Define Primary Emotional Angle**: Choose from curiosity, validation, ambition, relief, inspiration, urgency, discovery
2. **Create Multiple Wrappers**: Package the same core message for different emotional states
3. **Test and Optimize**: Track which emotional angles resonate with each audience segment

## Key Signature Elements
- Always include "building in the open" when discussing transparency
- Use "AI commoditizes text, not taste" when discussing human creativity
- Emphasize "quality needs an emotional key to unlock distribution"
- Open with vivid scenes and dialogue following Alexander's narrative style
