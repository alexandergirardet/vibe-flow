# Content Workflow Automation

## GitHub-Native Content Operations

### Repository Structure
This repository follows a specific structure for systematic content marketing:
- [@strategy](mdc:strategy) - Living strategy documents and analysis
- [content/](mdc:content) - Published content organized by type
- [templates/](mdc:templates) - Reusable content frameworks
- [automation/](mdc:automation) - N8N workflows and Airtable schemas

### Content Creation Process
1. **Strategy Reference**: Always consult @strategy folder before creating content
2. **Template Usage**: Start with appropriate template from [templates/](mdc:templates)
3. **Version Control**: Treat each content piece as a feature branch
4. **Automated Research**: Use N8N workflows to gather market intelligence
5. **AI-Assisted Generation**: Generate content following brand guidelines
6. **Collaborative Review**: Use pull requests for content approval

### Integration Points

#### Airtable Content Calendar
- Content ideas tracked in [content-calendar-schema.json](mdc:automation/airtable-schemas/content-calendar-schema.json)
- Status pipeline: Idea → Research → In Progress → Review → Published
- Performance metrics automatically tracked post-publication

#### N8N Automation Workflows
- Research workflow triggered by new Airtable entries
- Content generation using strategy documents and templates
- GitHub commits created automatically for review process
- Multi-platform distribution upon approval

### Quality Standards
- Every piece must include specific data and timeframes
- Open with human moments following Alexander's narrative style
- Include clear, actionable frameworks
- Maintain collaborative rather than prescriptive tone
- Reference [.cursorrules](mdc:.cursorrules) for consistent voice

## File Naming Conventions
- Blog posts: `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-title.md`
