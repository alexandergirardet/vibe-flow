### Step 3: Emotional Wrapper Framework Development

**Objective:** Create emotional angles for packaging your core messages

**Prompt to Use:**

```
Based on our audience emotional state and the key messages we want to communicate about [your product/service/expertise], develop multiple emotional wrappers for the same core content.

For each key message, create variations using these emotional frameworks:
1. **Triumph/Success** - Achievement and victory angles
2. **Vulnerability/Struggle** - Behind-the-scenes and failure stories
3. **Controversy/Debate** - Challenging conventional wisdom
4. **Curiosity/Mystery** - Intriguing questions and reveals
5. **Community/Belonging** - Shared identity and values
6. **Urgency/FOMO** - Time-sensitive opportunities
7. **Humor/Entertainment** - Lighthearted and amusing takes

Think about how the same factual content can tell completely different emotional stories.

```

**What You'll Get:**

- Emotional wrapper taxonomy
- Message variation matrix
- Storytelling angle bank
- Tone of voice options
- Audience connection points

**Expected Output:** Framework for transforming any message into multiple emotional packages.
