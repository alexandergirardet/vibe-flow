# Strategy Folder Organization

## Overview
All strategy workflows and outputs must be scoped to the [@strategy](mdc:strategy) folder. This ensures consistent organization and easy access to strategic documents.

## Folder Structure

### Core Strategy Areas
- **Tone of Voice**: All brand voice guidelines, writing patterns, and communication style documentation
- **Target Audience Analysis**: Audience research, personas, and demographic insights
- **Competitor Tracking/Analysis**: Competitive intelligence, market positioning, and competitor content analysis

### Specialized Strategy Areas
- **Blog Strategy**: SEO analysis, content planning, and blog-specific strategic insights should be scoped to `strategy/blog/`

## File Organization Rules

### When working on strategy documents:
1. **Always scope to @strategy folder** - Use `@strategy` when referencing or creating strategy files
2. **Use clear, descriptive filenames** following the pattern: `strategy-type-specific-focus.md`
3. **Reference existing strategy files** when creating new content to maintain consistency

### Key Strategy Files:
- [tone_of_voice.md](mdc:strategy/tone_of_voice.md) - Brand voice guidelines and writing patterns
- [brand_analysis.md](mdc:strategy/brand_analysis.md) - Comprehensive brand positioning analysis
- [market_research.md](mdc:strategy/market_research.md) - Market insights and opportunities
- [competitor_tracking.md](mdc:strategy/competitor_tracking.md) - Ongoing competitive intelligence

## Workflow Integration
- Content creation should always reference relevant strategy documents from @strategy
- Templates in [templates/](mdc:templates) should align with strategy guidelines
- All AI-generated content must incorporate strategy folder insights for brand consistency, including target analsyis and tone of voice.
