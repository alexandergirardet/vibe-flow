This rule dictates how to interact with and create strategy documents.

All strategy workflows and outputs must be scoped to the @strategy folder. This ensures consistent organization and easy access to strategic documents.

When a user requests you to create strategy documentation they must be scoped to one of three files:

- **Tone of Voice**: All brand voice guidelines, writing patterns, and communication style documentation
- **Target Audience Analysis**: Audience research, personas, and demographic insights
- **Competitor Tracking/Analysis**: Competitive intelligence, market positioning, and competitor content analysis

If your research is content format specific such as blog posts you can use the sub-folders. 

For example:
**Blog Strategy**: SEO analysis, content planning, and blog-specific strategic insights should be scoped to `strategy/blog/`

## File Organization Rules

### When working on strategy documents:
1. **Always scope to @strategy folder** - Use `@strategy` when referencing or creating strategy files
2. **Use clear, descriptive filenames** - Ensure all of your analysis is scoped to one of the files mentioned above. Do not create new ones
3. **Reference existing strategy files** when creating new content to maintain consistency
