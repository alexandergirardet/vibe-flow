## Introduction: Why Most Ecommerce Automation Fails (And the Kattnakken Story)

In the competitive world of ecommerce, many businesses embrace automation, yet 71% of companies struggle with workflows that simply don’t convert. Imagine a vulnerable Cannes failure story where potential was buried under generic automated processes. That’s where Kattnakken found its breakthrough by combining genuine storytelling with sophisticated automation systems.
